 WHAT IS ARRAY? SYNTAX FOR CREATING ARRAY?. 
• An Array is a collection of finite set of homogenous data. 
o Finite – fixed in size 
o Homogenous – same type of value 
• Whenever the programmer wants to store multiple values of the same 
type into the memory then instead of creating multiple variables of same 
type they can make use of array concept. 
• If we try to insert / print value from an index which is not present then 
the JVM will throw RTE. (Array index out of bounds exception). 
• Syntax for finding size / length of the array, 
* arrayname.length 
Syntax for creating array: 
Approach 1: 
Syntax: 
Datatype[] arrayname = new datatype[size] 
Ex: 
Int[] a1 = new int [5]; 
Approach 2: 
Syntax: 
Datatype[] arrayname = {v1,v2,v3,……,vn}; 
Ex: 
Int[] a1 = {10,20,30,40}
